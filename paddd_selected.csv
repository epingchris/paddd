The concession lasts for 15 years with possible 10-year extension (Foges 2010, Let our River Flow 2010),

“It is very concerning that we would even contemplate a dam in a nature reserve,” said Lisel Alamilla, the Executive Director of Ya’axché Conservation Trust. Ya’axché is considering taking the Government to the Supreme Court for an injunction if the activities inside Bladen Nature Reserve are allowed to proceed. They believe it is “a complete disregard for the Laws of Belize, specifically the National Parks Systems Act.” (Foges 2010)

In November of last year Ya’axché Conservation Trust discovered that Belize Hydroelectric Development (BHD) had conducted an illegal ‘feasibility study’ for a proposed hydroelectric dam within the pristine, strictly protected Bladen Nature Reserve. When this illegal activity was discovered, the Belizean Ministry of Natural Resources and Forest Department ceased their actions since they had no legitimate documents for their entrance and any other activities in any protected area. 

Later, however, BHD was granted access to the nature reserve through a research permit given by the Belize Forest Department signed by the Prime Minister himself to do a research of the area, which is the subject of this PADDD event (Let our River Flow 2010, McLoughlin 2010)","Foges, R.

Background:
This event is one of 27 known PADDD events in Snuol Wildlife Sanctuary.  In 2009 and 2010, there were a number of Economic Land Concessions (ELC’s) granted to companies within Snuol Wildlife Sanctuary via sub-decrees from the Government of Cambodia for the purpose of establishing rubber plantations.  For most concessions, this followed a two-step process: (1) The concession was initially granted as a “sustainable use zone,” (allowing rubber plantation development) and was still zoned as state public land, and (2) The concession was re-zoned as state private land.  As the first step changed the allowed land use, this constitutes a downgrade (i.e., PADDD event).  The second step does not change the allowed land use and the concessions are still within federal ownership, so these do not constitute additional PADDD events.  Accordingly, all information for the preceding have been combined into single events for each concession.  Subsequent to the above process, some ELC’s underwent a third “step,” where another sub-decree excised a portion of a given concession that was donated “to the people” or designated as a “community area.”  These events constitute a downsize, and thus a new PADDD event.","LICADHO (Cambodian League for the Promotion and Defense of Human Rights), 2013.

Details: Prime Minister Hun Sen has authorised the felling of about 9,000 hectares of protected forestland in Ratanakkiri’s Vereak Chey National Park by a private company for a new rubber plantation. A sub- decree signed by Hun Sen on February 15 stated that rights to clear-cut part of the protected forest area would be granted to the Srun Sovannaphoum Investment Co Ltd to plant rubber as part of a new special economic zone in Ratanakkiri province.
Ratanakkiri provincial governor Pav Hamphan said yesterday that he was not aware of the sub-decree granting development of a portion of the national park, which consists of about 332,500 total hectares of forest land.
